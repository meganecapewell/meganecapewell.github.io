        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p class="intro">I am currently learning web developement and programming throughout the summer with an online course from Udemy.  My goal is to learn to do to CSS, HTML, Javascript, Bootstrap, REST, and then move into Python, and more C++.  I do have experience in C++, Java, and basic command line, but I also want to have a bigger, more expansive understanding of the current skills I have in those languages.</p>

          <h3>Drinking Coffee</h3>
          <p>I drink too much coffee, I'm like the real-life Lorelai Gilmore, who drink too much.  My favorite coffe at Starbucks changes, sometimes its a caramel macciato, or sometimes its a green tea latte.  </p>

          <h3>Play Guitar</h3>
          <p>I can play guitar almost as good as a professional...maybe.  I started playing guitar when I was really young, I started with plastic strings, and then gradually graduated to an even bigger guitar with metal strings.</p>
